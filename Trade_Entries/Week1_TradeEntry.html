      <p>Good day all! </p>
      <p> Trading is foreign to me. I never thought of trading. With public perception, it seems like
you are sacrificing part of your life away for uncertain gains. Long-term buy and hold were the route I
took with investments. </p>
      <p>I eventually noticed the flaws in the strategy. With limited capital, my profits were limited.
As I am serving National Service in Singapore, my monthly allowance is not enough. Relying on injected
capital ensures my portfolio remain small. </p>
      <p>By holding long, I was dependant on the price only going up. My money was not working during 
side-ways or the market downtrend. It also assumes my selected coins will survive over a long period of time.
No amount of research can protect me from black swan events. Most coins die. </p> 
      <p>It hit me. Trading helps me de-risk. When taking profit in trading, I will be able to accumulate
“free” coins. By not continuously risking my money every time I wanted to buy, I can hold long-term with
coins I want without having to chuck more money in. </p>  
    <p>I watched QuickFingers Luc more actively. Trading was not a short-term get rich quick strategy
but a skill that is honed over years. I implemented habits in my morning routine, where I set alerts and
draw bases on charts daily. Ensuring that I can wait for the opportunity to arise instead of constantly
camping at my phone. </p> 
    <p>There are no regrets. With charts constantly moving, the next opportunity is always out there.
I have to learn that ‘Any profit is a good trade’. It was crucial if I made the right call and 
execution during trades. </p>
