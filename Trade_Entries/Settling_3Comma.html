      <p>Good day all! </p>
      <p>When Binance.com was banned in Singapore, I moved to FTX. 3 Comma’s was in a partnership
with FTX and the pro plan was free to use. I decided that maybe it was time to start actively using bots
again.</p>
<p>As I discovered different strategies from Youtubers and Discord groups. In order to compound my profits, I
needed to have bots that complement each other and me in my financial situation. I needed to sit down and
focus on a specific strategy that will work for me. </p>
<p>By being on a low bank roll, I need to have bots open/close deals consistently to generate USD. I could not afford
to have bots stuck in deals or big deals. I needed a bot that was quickly finish deals and move on the
next one. </p>
<p>An issue I faced was that my bots were stuck in deals. With the settings I used, the bots just simply open and closed deals when possible.
This resulted in buying at the peak or the start of major dips. Profit was consistent and I was trading
on pairs that I believed in.  Being unable to close deals was not an issue for me as I believe that the
price would recover some time later.</p>
<p>My concern was the amount of time I was losing. I seen deals taking a long period of time to close and there were some weeks where no profit was made.
I had to find possible settings for the bots to open and close deals under certain conditions rather
than simply doing it when they could.</p>
<p>3 Comma’s the platform, allows back-testing of bots. People often back test to major market movements to see how their bots perform. However, as there are way too many variables. Such as when deals are started, what pairs are they trading on and how it performs in all market trends. 
    I believe back testing a specific period of time is not an effective strategy and should be taken
with a grain of salt. I will not be sharing settings. </p>
<p>I need to put money on the table and record my results and behaviour of the bots daily. Even looking at price chart movement to figure out strategies for specific pairs. </p>
<p>My starting investment is 2k USD. On conservative settings, the average ROI is 0.3%. With aggressive settings or by overextending, average ROI is 0.6% or more. I aim to achieve a daily average ROI of 0.5% which would be 10 USD per day.  
My results would be captured on a monthly basis. </p>
