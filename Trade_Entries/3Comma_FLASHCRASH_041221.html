        <h1>3 Commas : FLASH CRASH 04/12/21 Bot Review</h1>
        <h3><b>"Perfect is the enemy of good." </b></h3>
    <div class="articleBox">
     <p>Good day all! After the recent flash crash on 04 DEC 2021 , I spent some time reflecting on my current botting strategy. Despite being abit overextended , the bots
     managed to bounce back and I was able to take profit from my deals.</p>
     <p> Lets go over the bad. As the whole market crashed , my funds were being used by the bots. Certain bots were not able to average down their buying price and
         take profit.</p>
     <p> Look at the BTC Graph below: <p>

        <p>Though I managed to close the deal and take profit soon after. If the deal was closed earlier , funds could be allocated to my other bots. I was fortunate
        enough to survive through this flash crash. I needed to de-risk.</p>
        <p> One thing I am thankful for was implementing 'Deal Start Conditions' to the bots. I was previously using ASAP where the bots will just buy as soon as a 
        deal was completed.</p>

        <p> As you can see , my bot bought at the peak and took 21 days to close a deal. If I had place certain trade conditions instead of ASAP , my funds would not be
        hogged up. Precious time wasted and a part of my capital was being occupied for no reason. </p>
     
     <p> I am thankful that majority of bots stood strong during the flash crash. I need to continue learning and tweaking the settings to ensure I can survive future
         crashes. </p>
