        <h1>Learning about QFL strategy</h1>
        <h3><b>‘The market falls but the buyers are still there.’ No matter what, 
there are always buyers in the market. </b></h3>
    <div class="articleBox">
        <p> Good day all! This is the first part of me learning about the QFL strategy from the trader
Quickfingers Luc (QFL).  I plan to incorporate the QFL strategy into my 3 Comma’s Trading Bots. My goal
is creating a side-income stream through trading bots. I see the potential and aim to have a better
understanding of the 3 Comma’s platform. 
       </p>
       <p>For this QFL video, QFL teaches how he views support and resistance lines. 
Video Link is in the description below. 
       </p>
       <p>Let’s go over on support lines or as QFL refers to it as bases. Support levels
or bases is a drawn line that shows that the price level that an asset does not fall below for a
period of time. 
      </p>
      <p>When the price reaches an identified support, it would be likely to bounce off the support.
This results in an increase in asset price. Imagine dropping a ball, when it touches the floor, the ball
would bounce back up. This can mean that there is currently a good buying opportunity when the price
bounces off the support.
       </p>

      <p>Now that we explained what are support lines, does it mean we should just buy assets when they touch
the support line? Not really, QFL showed multiple examples when the floor breaks.If you bought at the
support line, you would have immediately lost your money.
      </p>
        <p>Are there buyers in the market? When past supports are suddenly broken, panic is created
amongst the holders. This causes further sell-offs and a further dip in price. However, when there are
many buyers in an asset, a followed-up increase in price after the dip can be expected. 
        <b>The buyers are taking over.</b> 
       </p>

        <p>If you are fast enough, the bounce back followed by the dip can provide quick profit
opportunities. The way he showed in the video was to Dollar Cost Average and set multiple orders as we 
would not know where the bottom of the dip is. The key is to increase the order size as the price
goes lower in order to lower our average entry price. This allows us to take profit and exit earlier.
        </p>
        <p>After watching, I realised my use of bases and supports was wrong. I often referenced historical supports and tried to actively find a pattern. A base should be focused on current prices, not what happened in the past. Historical bases are often used to justify that an asset would not reach 
        below a certain price or that bounce back to resistance is certain. </p> 
        <p>I would like to say that this is not financial advice. I wrote this through my point of view as an amateur trader and what were my takeaways from his videos. I apologise if I left out key examples or mis-interpreted his explanations. This is what I learnt and hopefully, I can achieve a better 
        understanding as I continue watching.
       </p>
        <p><b>Thank you for reading! Good day all!</b></p>
