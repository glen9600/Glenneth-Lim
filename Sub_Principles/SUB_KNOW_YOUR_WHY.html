        <p>“I am interested in the game only as I play it for myself and in my own way.” Everyone is born with a unique set of circumstances. You will need to learn to make 
        and trust your own judgement if you expect to achieve anything.</p>
        <h2>1.2) There is no bull or bear side, but the right side.</h2>
        <p>“Events, not vanity, proved for me that I could read the tape more accurately than most of the people aroun me.” If your producing the results you desire, is that not 
        good enough. Holding yourself accountable to both your failures and results, allows you to create better systems and though processes.</p>
