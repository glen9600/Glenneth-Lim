        <p>a)<b>“The average man doesn’t wish to be told that it is a bull or bear market. What he desires is to be told specifically which particular stock to buy or sell.
He wants to get something for nothing. He does not wish to work. He doesn’t even wish to have to think. It is too much bother to have to count the money that he
            picks up from the ground.”</b> When things turn sour, the same people that you give advice to will hold you accountable to any mistakes due to your tip.
They want the results without knowing the hard work it takes to reach there.</p>
