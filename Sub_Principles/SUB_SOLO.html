        <h2>3.1) Choose to play a solo hand.</h2>
        <p>“Instead of standing or falling by my own observation and deductions I was merely playing another man’s game.” By relying on someone's tip , I become dependant on 
        that individual. If I do not act on my own accord, my temperament would not be the same. This always resultsin making bad moves.</p>
        <h2>3.1) Be accountable to your own mistakes. </h2>
        <p>“If a man didn’t make mistakes, he’d own the world in a month. But if he didn’t profit by his mistakes, he wouldn’t own a blessed thing.” I believe that most mistakes
        can be observed. However, a issue that pops up constantly is dealing with the emotional discomfort from being wrong , it sucks. By slowly getting into
        the habit of humbling myself and owning up , I managed to learn from my personal failures.</p>
